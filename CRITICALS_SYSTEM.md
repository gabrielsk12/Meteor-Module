## Exploitation Strategies

### 1. Packet Critical
**How it works:** Sends fake position packets to simulate a jump  
**Detection Risk:** Medium (40%)  
**Execution Speed:** 5ms (Very Fast)  
**Damage Multiplier:** 1.5x  

**Features:**
- Adaptive offset variation (0.05-0.08)
- Anti-pattern delay (50ms minimum)
- Ground/water/lava checks
- Vehicle detection

**Code:**
```java
// Sends 2 packets:
// 1. Position + 0.0625 (up)
// 2. Position + 0.0 (down)
```

### 2. Velocity Critical
**How it works:** Manipulates player velocity for mini-jump  
**Detection Risk:** Low (20%)  
**Execution Speed:** 15ms (Slower but safer)  
**Damage Multiplier:** 1.5x  

**Features:**
- Human-like velocity variation (0.08-0.12)
- Natural jump simulation
- More anti-cheat resistant
- No packet spam

**Code:**
```java
// Sets velocity.y to 0.08-0.12
// Looks like natural jump movement
```

### 3. Jump Reset Critical
**How it works:** Exploits jump reset mechanics  
**Detection Risk:** Medium-Low (30%)  
**Execution Speed:** 10ms (Fast)  
**Damage Multiplier:** 1.5x  

**Features:**
- 3-phase execution
- Ground packet reset
- More sophisticated
- Hard to detect

**Phases:**
1. Small upward velocity (0.1)
2. Send ground packet (reset)
3. Complete critical hit

### 4. Multi-Packet Critical
**How it works:** Sends multiple packets simulating jump arc  
**Detection Risk:** Medium-High (50%)  
**Execution Speed:** 3ms (Fastest)  
**Damage Multiplier:** 1.5x  

**Features:**
- 4-packet sequence
- Simulates realistic jump arc
- Micro-variation for each packet
- Highest DPS

**Sequence:**
```
Packet 1: +0.0625
Packet 2: +0.0433
Packet 3: +0.0247
Packet 4: +0.0
```

## AI System

### Behavior Tree
```
Root (Selector)
├── High Threat Sequence
│   ├── Check if high threat
│   └── Use fastest strategy
├── Low Detection Sequence
│   ├── Check if low detection risk
│   └── Use safest strategy
└── Default: Balanced strategy
```

### Decision Making

**High Threat Conditions:**
- 3+ hostile entities nearby
- Player health < 8.0 HP
- Multiple attackers

**Action:** Use **Multi-Packet** (fastest)

**Low Detection Conditions:**
- Detection level < 30%
- Fail count < 3
- Safe environment

**Action:** Use **Velocity** (safest)

**Balanced Conditions:**
- Normal combat scenario
- Medium threat level
- No special conditions

**Action:** Use **Jump Reset** (balanced)

### Adaptive Strategy Switching

The AI automatically switches strategies based on:
1. **Threat Level** (0.0-1.0)
2. **Detection Risk** (0.0-1.0)
3. **Success Rate** (%)
4. **Environment Conditions**

Strategies are scored:
```java
score = detectionRisk * 0.5 + executionSpeed * 0.5
```

Lower score = better strategy for current situation.

## Machine Learning

### Timing Prediction

The ML system predicts optimal critical timing using:

**Input Features:**
- Distance to target
- Player health ratio
- Target health ratio
- Player velocity
- Ground status
- Movement direction
- Environment factors

**Output:**
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Recommended strategy
- Risk assessment

### Learning Process

1. **Record Combat Actions**
   ```java
   mlLearner.recordCombatAction(target, action);
   ```

2. **Train Neural Network**
   - Combat network: 20-64-32-10
   - Real-time background training
   - Learns player preferences

3. **Predict Optimal Timing**
   ```java
   double confidence = mlPredictor.predictOptimalTiming(target);
   if (confidence >= threshold) {
       executeCritical();
   }
   ```

### ML Confidence Factors

**Increases Confidence:**
- Distance 3-4 blocks (+0.2)
- Health ratio > 70% (+0.15)
- Target health < 30% (+0.1)
- Standing still (+0.1)

**Decreases Confidence:**
- Distance < 2 blocks (-0.1)
- Health ratio < 30% (-0.2)
- Not on ground (-0.3)

## Usage

### Mode 1: AI (Recommended)
**Best for:** Maximum intelligence and adaptation

```java
mode = AI
useML = true
mlThreshold = 0.6
adaptiveStrategy = true
threatBased = true
```

**Behavior:**
- ML predicts optimal timing
- AI selects best strategy
- Adapts to combat conditions
- Learns from player behavior

### Mode 2: Smart
**Best for:** Manual strategy with ML timing

```java
mode = Smart
strategy = JumpReset
useML = true
mlThreshold = 0.7
```

**Behavior:**
- ML predicts timing
- Uses selected strategy
- No strategy switching

### Mode 3: Manual
**Best for:** Full manual control

```java
mode = Manual
strategy = Packet
```

**Behavior:**
- No AI
- No ML
- Fixed strategy
- Basic checks only

## Performance

### Statistics

## Anti-Detection Features

### Pattern Variation
- Random offset variation
- Adaptive delay timing
- Strategy rotation

useML = true
mlThreshold = 0.5
adaptiveStrategy = true
threatBased = false
```
- Uses fastest strategies
- Lower threshold (more aggressive)
- Focuses on damage

### Balanced
```java
mode = AI
strategy = JumpReset
useML = true
mlThreshold = 0.6
adaptiveStrategy = true
threatBased = true
```
- Balanced approach
- Adapts to situations
- Good for general use

## Advanced Tips

### 1. Let AI Learn
Play normally for 1-2 hours with AI mode enabled. The system will learn your playstyle and adapt.

### 2. Monitor Detection Level
If detection level > 50%, the system will automatically use safer strategies.

### 3. Adjust ML Threshold
- Lower (0.4-0.5): More aggressive, more criticals
- Medium (0.6-0.7): Balanced
- Higher (0.8-0.9): Conservative, only when confident

### 4. Strategy Selection
- **Packet**: Fast, reliable, medium risk
- **Velocity**: Safe, human-like, slow
- **Jump Reset**: Balanced, sophisticated
- **Multi-Packet**: Fastest, highest risk

### 5. Threat-Based Combat
Enable threat-based mode for intelligent adaptation:
- High threat → Fast strategies
- Low threat → Safe strategies
- Medium threat → Balanced
