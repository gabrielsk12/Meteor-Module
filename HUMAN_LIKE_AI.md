# 🧠 ADVANCED HUMAN-LIKE AI SYSTEM

## Overview
Every aspect of the bot now behaves **EXACTLY like a real player** using sophisticated AI systems that simulate:
- Physical limitations (reaction time, mouse control, fatigue)
- Cognitive processes (attention, learning, decision-making)
- Emotional states (stress, focus, tiredness)
- Skill progression (beginner → expert over time)
- Human imperfections (mistakes, hesitation, errors)

---

## 🎯 Core AI Systems

### **1. HumanBehaviorSimulator**
Simulates complete human psychology and physiology.

#### **Physical State Simulation:**
- **Reaction Time**: 200-300ms average (varies with fatigue/stress/focus)
  - Fresh & Focused: 150-250ms
  - Tired & Stressed: 300-500ms
  - Panic State: 400-600ms

- **Fatigue System**:
  - Increases over session time (max at 2 hours)
  - Effects: Slower reactions, worse accuracy, more mistakes
  - Visible signs: Longer delays, shakier aim, more errors

- **Focus System**:
  - High Focus: Better accuracy, faster reactions
  - Low Focus: Distracted, random attention shifts
  - Flow State: Peak performance (moderate activity + low stress)

- **Stress System**:
  - Increases in combat or high-pressure situations
  - Effects: Worse accuracy, faster but less precise movements
  - Panic Mode (>70% stress): Erratic, shaky, poor decisions

#### **Emotional States:**
Each emotion affects performance differently:
- **NEUTRAL**: Normal performance
- **FOCUSED**: +10% accuracy, -30ms reaction time
- **EXCITED**: -30ms reaction time, slightly less accurate
- **ANXIOUS**: -15% accuracy, +50ms reaction time
- **TIRED**: -20% accuracy, +80ms reaction time
- **ANGRY**: -10% accuracy, +40ms reaction time
- **CALM**: Steady performance

#### **Skill Progression:**
Players improve over time with practice:
- **BEGINNER**: 30% skill level, 85% base accuracy
- **INTERMEDIATE**: 50% skill level, 90% accuracy (+5% bonus)
- **ADVANCED**: 70% skill level, 95% accuracy (+10% bonus)
- **EXPERT**: 90% skill level, 100% accuracy (+15% bonus)

Progression:
- 50 actions → Intermediate

## 💡 Usage Examples

### **Example 1: Combat**
```java
// Old way (obvious bot):
player.lookAt(target);
player.attack();

// New way (like real player):
HumanBehaviorSimulator.updateHumanState();
if (HumanBehaviorSimulator.shouldHesitate()) {
    Thread.sleep(HumanBehaviorSimulator.getHesitationDuration());
}
RotationSimulator.RotationResult rotation = RotationSimulator.getTrackingRotation(target);
player.setYaw(rotation.yaw);
player.setPitch(rotation.pitch);
if (rotation.success && !HumanBehaviorSimulator.shouldMakeMistake()) {
    Thread.sleep(HumanBehaviorSimulator.getReactionTime());
    player.attack();
}
HumanBehaviorSimulator.recordAction("combat", true);
```

### **Example 2: Movement**
```java
// Old way:
player.setVelocity(direction.multiply(speed));

// New way:
MovementPatternSimulator.MovementInput input = 
    MovementPatternSimulator.getNaturalMovementInput(direction);
    
if (MovementPatternSimulator.shouldWTap()) {
    input.forward = 0; // Release W
    Thread.sleep(MovementPatternSimulator.getWTapDuration());
}

applyNaturalAcceleration(input);
```

### **Example 3: Block Placement**
```java
// Old way:
player.lookAt(blockPos);
player.placeBlock();

// New way:
Vec3d targetPos = HumanBehaviorSimulator.addPredictionError(blockPos);
RotationSimulator.RotationResult rotation = 
    RotationSimulator.lookAtWithHumanError(targetPos, 0.1);

if (rotation.success) {
    if (random.nextDouble() < HumanBehaviorSimulator.getAimAccuracy("placement")) {
        Thread.sleep(100 + random.nextInt(150)); // Placement delay
        player.placeBlock();
        HumanBehaviorSimulator.recordAction("placement", true);
    } else {
        // Missed! Try again
        HumanBehaviorSimulator.recordAction("placement", false);
    }
}
